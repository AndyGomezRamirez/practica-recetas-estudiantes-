# Task Completion Checklist

## Before Completing Any Coding Task

### 1. Code Quality Checks
- **Run ESLint**: `npm run lint` - Must pass without errors
- **TypeScript Compilation**: `npm run build` - Must compile successfully
- **Code Review**: Ensure code follows project conventions

### 2. Functionality Testing
- **Manual Testing**: Test new functionality in browser
- **Development Server**: Use `npm run dev` to test locally
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Verify functionality works as expected

### 3. Code Standards Verification
- **TypeScript Types**: Ensure all props and functions are properly typed
- **React Patterns**: Verify proper use of hooks and component patterns
- **CSS Styling**: Check responsive design and visual consistency

### 4. Integration Testing
- **Context Integration**: Verify global state management works correctly
- **Router Integration**: Test navigation between pages
- **localStorage**: Verify data persistence functionality

## Required Commands to Run
1. **`npm run lint`** - MUST pass without errors
2. **`npm run build`** - MUST compile successfully

## Common Issues to Check
- **Missing TypeScript types**: All props and state must be typed
- **Unused imports**: Remove any unused import statements
- **Console errors**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- **React warnings**: Address any React development warnings
- **ESLint warnings**: Fix all linting issues

## Final Verification
- Code builds without errors
- Linter passes without warnings
- Functionality works as expected in browser
- TypeScript types are correct and comprehensive
- No console errors or warnings

## Notes
- No test framework is currently configured
- Focus on manual testing and code quality tools
- Ensure educational objectives are met (proper React patterns)
- Maintain consistency with existing codebase patterns
